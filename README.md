This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Daniel Philpott and I'm a 25 year old student at Boise State University. I study Computer Science and currently work in the industry of project management full-time. At home, I've got a wife and 3 year old daughter, both of which mean the world to me!
